The files in this directory are taken from the latest Bicep CI build on the [hackathon branch](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/tree/hackathon), to make it simple to create a devcontainer instance.

For example, under https://github.com/Azure/bicep/actions/runs/3094871715 - download `vscode.bicep.vsix` and `bicep-release-linux-x64` and put them in this folder.
